# Neo4J Roadmap

## User management:
Store and manage user profiles and their relationships with other users, such as friends, groups, or organizations. This can enable features like private channels, group channels, or organization-wide channels for communication.

## Real-time location sharing:
If your app supports location-based features, you can use Neo4j to store and manage the real-time location of users and the relationships between users and locations. This can enable features like location-based channels or emergency assistance.
